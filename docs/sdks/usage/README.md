# Usage
(*usage*)

## Overview

Endpoints related to organization usage exports.

The Usage API is an API provided by CircleCI to customers to access all of their usage data on CircleCI. It contains all the metadata (org, project, pipeline, workflow, and job dimensions) as well as credit consumption data. It is provided at the near lowest level of granularity (at the job run level).

__Restrictions__

* Max result set size of 100MB
* Query timeout of 4 hours.
* Max date window of 32 days
* No PII is surfaced in the Usage API (e.g. email address, Github login name)
* The POST endpoint can only be queried up to (i.e. is rate limited to) 10 times per hour per org
* The GET endpoint can only be queried up to (i.e. is rate limited to) 10 times per minute per org
* To increase performance the API can generate multiple CSV files that need to be merged after download

__Requirements__

* organization ID - To get your organization ID go to to Organization Settings tab in the CircleCI app. ie https://app.circleci.com/settings/organization/<vcs>/<org name>/overview
* API Personal Access Token - https://circleci.com/docs/managing-api-tokens/
